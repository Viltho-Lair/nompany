- One row per vendor.
- Name is the only required cell. Leave any other cell empty rather than guessing.
- Item Types is what the vendor supplies. Put a delivery time in weeks after a colon if you know it, separate several types with semicolons, and wrap the whole cell in double quotes — for example: \"Microphones:4; Speakers:6; Cabling\"

- صف واحد لكل مورد.
- الاسم هو الحقل المطلوب الوحيد. اترك أي خانة أخرى فارغة بدل تخمينها.
- خانة Item Types هي ما يورده المورد. ضع مدة التوريد بالأسابيع بعد نقطتين إن عرفتها، وافصل بين الأنواع بفاصلة منقوطة، وضع الخانة كاملة بين علامتي اقتباس مزدوجتين — مثال: \"ميكروفونات:4; سماعات:6; كابلات\"
- وضع أي خانة أخرى تحتوي على فاصلة بين علامتي اقتباس مزدوجتين أيضا.
- لا تخترع موردين أو جهات اتصال أو بريدا إلكترونيا أو أرقام هواتف. استخدم ما أعطيك فقط.
